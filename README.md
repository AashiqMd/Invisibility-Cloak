# Invisibility-Cloak
This project is essentially a colour segmentation problem with some morphological processing.

In this simple OpenCV project, we were able to learn the following concepts:
1. Argument parser for cmd friendly commands
2. Capturing frame by frame data from video or camera
3. Colour Spaces and how to convert between them
4. Generating colour segmentation masks
5. Running morphological processes such as Open and Dilate
6. Bitwise commands on nupmy arrays.
7. Real time input recording using waitKey(1) and ord('q')
